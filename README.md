# Tajheez Monorepo

This workspace hosts the Tajheez backend (`backend/`), frontend (`frontend/`), SQL assets (`sql/`), and supporting docs (`documnets/`). To understand workflows, coding style, and review expectations, start with the contributor playbook in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

Additional module-specific instructions:
- `frontend/README.md` — default Next.js usage directions.
- `documnets/API_Documentation.md` — REST contract summary.
- `documnets/TAJHEEZ_Combined_Frontend_Developer_Document.md` — product and UI context.

Keep new documentation near related code and update the guides above whenever behavior or APIs change.
